From your logs, the AI’s JSON is sending:

communicationStyle (camelCase) instead of communication_style (snake_case)
callSid and caller are missing entirely
Your server code likely expects:

js
Copy
req.body.communication_style
…which is showing up as “MISSING” in your debug output. Because the final code tries to insert communication_style but the JSON only has communicationStyle, that field never gets mapped into your database.

Additionally, if your /receive-data logic relies on callSid or caller to look up the contact, and both are missing, the code may fail to find a matching contact—thus skipping the insert.

Two Ways to Fix the Mapping Issue
Approach A: Match Field Names Exactly
Rename the AI’s output from communicationStyle → communication_style.
If your agent prompt or Eleven Labs config is under your control, instruct it to place the user’s answer in communication_style.
For example, your system prompt or “conversation_config_override” might say:
“Store the answer in a field named communication_style (snake case).”

OR Adjust your Express code to handle either naming:
js
Copy
const communication_style = req.body.communication_style 
  || req.body.communicationStyle 
  || null;
If you see no caller or callSid, your code should either:
Gracefully handle the missing phone number (maybe parse it from the raw transcript?), or
Hardcode a fallback if you know the user’s phone number.
If you skip the contact lookup, you can do a direct insert with a placeholder contact_id if that’s acceptable.
Approach B: Parse the raw_transcript with an LLM (Ignoring Field Mismatches)
You asked about simply taking the raw_transcript and having a separate step parse it. That’s absolutely doable. The flow would be:

Always store raw_transcript in your DB. (Even if communicationStyle or other fields are missing or unrecognized.)
After the call, you run an LLM or a Node script that extracts the relevant answers from raw_transcript and updates your DB row.
For example:

js
Copy
// Insert only the raw transcript at first:
await client.query(`
  INSERT INTO intake_responses (
    contact_id, user_id, raw_transcript, created_at
  ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, NOW())
`, [contactId, userId, req.body.raw_transcript]);

// Later, call an LLM to parse each question's answer from the transcript
// Then do an UPDATE statement with the parsed results.
Pros:

You don’t rely on Eleven Labs perfectly naming fields.
You can re-parse or re-analyze the transcript at any time.
Cons:

More steps (you must implement or integrate an LLM to do the parsing).
Slightly more complicated logic (an extra call or CRON job for the parsing).
Recommended Quick Fix
Match the field name. In your system prompt or override JSON, specify:

“After each question, set communication_style to the user’s answer.”

(Instead of communicationStyle.)

Ensure either caller or phone_number is present. If you want to skip the phone-based contact lookup, just default to a known contact_id, or pass in req.body.phone_number.

That alone will let your existing code do:

js
Copy
INSERT INTO intake_responses (communication_style, professional_goals, ...)
…with the actual field data from Eleven Labs. Once you see in your logs that req.body.communication_style is no longer undefined, it should map into Supabase just fine.

If you continue to get callSid or caller as undefined, you can either:

Hardcode a contact_id, or
Let the personalization route provide the number so the AI can return it, or
Move entirely to “raw_transcript only” + a manual or LLM parsing step.
Either route is valid—matching field names is the simplest immediate solution. Then, if you want robust re-processing, you can store raw_transcript and parse it with an LLM later.
