Below is a concise recap of exactly how your code stored (and updated) call_sid and phone_number in the temp_calls table, drawing from the snippets you posted:

1. In the /voice Route (When Twilio First Hits Your Server)
File: twilio.js (or similar), inside router.post('/voice', ...)

js
Copy
router.post('/voice', async (req, res) => {
  const { From, CallSid } = req.body;  // From = caller's phone, CallSid = Twilio call SID
  console.log('Incoming call received. CallSid:', CallSid, 'From:', From);

  try {
    const pool = req.app.get('pool');
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');

      // 1) Insert into temp_calls so you can track the immediate call details
      await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO temp_calls (call_sid, phone_number, created_at)
         VALUES ($1, $2, NOW())`,
        [CallSid, From]
      );

      // 2) Also store in call_log (for debugging or a permanent record)
      await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO call_log (call_sid, phone_number, created_at)
         VALUES ($1, $2, NOW())
         ON CONFLICT (call_sid) DO NOTHING`,
        [CallSid, From]
      );

      await client.query('COMMIT');
      console.log(`Call from ${From} with SID ${CallSid} successfully logged`);
    } catch (error) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      throw error;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }

    // Then you redirect to ElevenLabs
    // ...
});
Why:
Twilio sends the initial inbound call to your /voice endpoint. You grab CallSid and From from req.body. You INSERT both into temp_calls, so you have a quick reference of which phone number is associated with that call_sid.

2. In the /twilio-personalization Route (When ElevenLabs Requests Context)
File: twilio.js (or wherever you handle personalization), inside router.post('/twilio-personalization', ...)

js
Copy
router.post('/twilio-personalization', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Possibly verify x-el-secret if ELEVENLABS_SECRET is set
    const { caller_id, call_sid } = req.body || {};
    if (!caller_id || !call_sid) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid payload' });
    }

    const pool = req.app.get('pool');
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      console.log(`Storing callSid ${call_sid} with phone ${caller_id} in temp_calls`);
      await client.query('BEGIN');

      // 1) Insert or update temp_calls in case we need the phone number again
      await client.query(`
        INSERT INTO temp_calls (call_sid, phone_number, created_at)
        VALUES ($1, $2, NOW())
        ON CONFLICT (call_sid) DO UPDATE
          SET phone_number = EXCLUDED.phone_number
      `, [call_sid, caller_id]);

      await client.query('COMMIT');
      console.log(`Successfully stored call data in temp_calls: CallSID=${call_sid}, Phone=${caller_id}`);
    } catch (tempCallsError) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      console.error('Error storing call info in temp_calls:', tempCallsError.message);
      // but you do NOT return an error to ElevenLabs, so it continues
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }

    // Then the rest of the logic: look up contact, return conversation_config_override, etc.
    // ...
});
Why:
When ElevenLabs calls your personalization webhook, it also passes call_sid and caller_id. You again insert or update temp_calls with (call_sid, caller_id) to ensure you have the correct number for that call_sid. The code uses ON CONFLICT (call_sid) DO UPDATE so if it already existed, you just update the phone number. This is helpful if Twilio’s /voice route had From in a different format, or if you want to override it with whatever ElevenLabs passes.

3. How the Data Was Used Later
In your final callback (POST /receive-data from ElevenLabs), you typically do:

js
Copy
// If the final callback only has a call_sid, we can match it in temp_calls
let callResult = await client.query(
  'SELECT phone_number FROM temp_calls WHERE call_sid = $1',
  [callSid]
);
if (callResult.rows.length > 0) {
  phoneNumber = callResult.rows[0].phone_number;
  console.log(`Found phone number ${phoneNumber} for callSid: ${callSid}`);
}
Why:
If the final callback only includes call_sid (and not the phone number), you can look it up in temp_calls to unify the record.

4. Summary
When Twilio first hits /voice, you do INSERT INTO temp_calls (call_sid, phone_number) so you can log the call SID and caller phone.
When ElevenLabs calls /twilio-personalization asking for conversation details, you again do an upsert to temp_calls in case caller_id changed or was formatted differently.
Finally, in your final callback /receive-data, you can do SELECT phone_number FROM temp_calls WHERE call_sid = $1 if you only have callSid.
This entire process ensures your final callback can unify the callSid → phoneNumber → contact logic, even if the final request only has a call SID (or different phone formatting).

That’s exactly how you “stored the data in the temp_calls table” in your older code.
