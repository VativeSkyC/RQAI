Meanwhile, in your personalization step, you see:

css
Copy
caller_id: '+15132017748'
Found existing contact: { id: 1, first_name: 'Testing' ... }
So during personalization, you successfully identify the phone number and the contact. But the final transcript from Eleven Labs has caller_id: "unknown" instead of +15132017748, so your code can’t match the contact. Hence, no insertion/update is happening.

Why This Happens
ElevenLabs typically makes two requests:

Personalization Webhook: caller_id: "+15132017748", which you use to find the contact. This ensures the AI can greet them by name, etc.

Final Transcript Webhook (/receive-data): Ideally also includes caller_id: "+15132017748" or callSid so you can do a matching DB insert.

But your final request shows caller_id: "unknown".
Because your code likely does something like:

js
Copy
// Pseudocode in /receive-data
const phone = req.body.caller_id || req.body.caller || req.body.phone_number;
if (!phone) {
  // or if phone === 'unknown'
  console.log('Cannot match contact - skipping or rolling back');
}
You see “Processing with idempotency key...” in logs but never see an INSERT or UPDATE message, which means your code is skipping the DB logic path (or rolling back) because it can’t match a contact by phone.

How to Fix It
You have two main options:

Option A: Make ElevenLabs Pass the Phone to /receive-data
In ElevenLabs:

Ensure that in your agent’s final transcript callback settings, the caller_id (or phone_number) is included. If you have a “Custom Field” or “Additional Param” in ElevenLabs for Twilio calls, set it so the final request body also includes caller_id: "+15132017748".
Result: You’ll see caller_id: "+15132017748" in the final request, and your code can do:

js
Copy
// /receive-data
const phone = req.body.caller_id; // now it's "+15132017748"
const contactResult = await client.query(
  'SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE phone_number = $1',
  [phone]
);
...
And you proceed to insert/update.

Option B: Use callSid and a temp_calls or call_log Table
If the final request includes callSid, you can store (callSid -> phone_number) in a table at the time of personalization, then do a lookup in /receive-data. For example:

At personalization:

js
Copy
await client.query(`
  INSERT INTO temp_calls (call_sid, phone_number)
  VALUES ($1, $2)
  ON CONFLICT (call_sid) DO UPDATE SET phone_number = EXCLUDED.phone_number
`, [callSid, "+15132017748"]);
In /receive-data:

js
Copy
const { callSid } = req.body;
if (callSid) {
  const tmpResult = await client.query(
    'SELECT phone_number FROM temp_calls WHERE call_sid = $1',
    [callSid]
  );
  if (tmpResult.rows.length > 0) {
    phone = tmpResult.rows[0].phone_number;
  }
}
But your logs show callSid: NOT PROVIDED as well, so you’d need to have ElevenLabs actually pass the final callSid. Right now, you see:

makefile
Copy
callSid: NOT PROVIDED
Hence you can’t do the callSid lookup either.

Option C: Hardcode or Bypass Contact Matching
If you only have one contact or you don’t need to match phone at all, you might do:

js
Copy
// /receive-data
// Always insert for contact #1
const contactId = 1; // or user’s ID
But that’s probably not desired.

Final Summary
Because your final transcript request has "caller_id": "unknown" and no callSid, your code can’t identify the contact. Therefore, it never commits the data to Supabase.

What you need:

Consistent phone (or callSid) from personalization all the way to /receive-data.
Modify the final webhook data or store (callSid -> phone_number) so you can do the final DB insert.
As soon as you see in logs:

sql
Copy
Caller: +15132017748
Found contact #1 ...
INSERT INTO intake_responses ...
COMMIT done
…you’ll know the data is going into Supabase successfully.
