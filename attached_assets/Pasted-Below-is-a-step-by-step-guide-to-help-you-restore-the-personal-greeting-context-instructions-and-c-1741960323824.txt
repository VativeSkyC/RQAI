Below is a step‐by‐step guide to help you restore the personal greeting, context instructions, and complete logging that appear to have vanished in your current Replit code. The short answer is: your twilio-personalization route lost (or changed) the snippet that provided the user’s name, requestor’s name, system instructions, and the “include raw transcript” command.

Follow these steps to bring back the greeting, context, and raw_transcript:

1. Locate Your twilio-personalization Route
Look in your routes/twilio.js (or a similar file) for something named:

js
Copy
router.post('/twilio-personalization', async (req, res) => { ... });
That route is the personalization webhook for ElevenLabs. This is where you:

Check the phone number (caller_id)
Look up the contact
Return the conversation instructions and greeting so ElevenLabs can start the call with the right context
2. Re-Add the Greeting and Instructions
Previously, you had code like:

js
Copy
// The userName of the agent or requestor
const userName = "Chase"; // or whatever name

// If contact is found:
const greeting = `Hello ${existingContact.first_name}, ${userName} asked me to learn more about your professional goals. When you're ready, let me know and we will get started.`;

// Then a systemPrompt that gives a multi-line set of instructions, like:
const systemPrompt = `
  You are an AI intake bot focusing on professional relationships for business leaders.
  You have four questions to ask the caller, in this sequence:
    1) Communication style
    2) Professional goals
    3) Values
    4) Partnership expectations
  
  After each question, if the caller’s answer is unclear, gently ask for clarification.
  Once all four questions are answered, say “Thank you for your time,” and end the call.

  Ensure to include the entire conversation in 'raw_transcript' in your final callback to /receive-data.
  DO NOT ask any unrelated questions.
`;

// Return the correct JSON shape that ElevenLabs inbound_call expects:
return res.status(200).json({
  dynamic_variables: {
    // any phone/callSid you want to pass
    callSid: call_sid,
    caller_phone: caller_id
  },
  conversation_config_override: {
    agent: {
      prompt: {
        prompt: systemPrompt
      },
      first_message: greeting,
      language: 'en'
    }
  }
});
Check if your current code is missing that greeting or replaced it with short text. If it’s missing, reinsert it with your desired greeting and instructions.
