The error retry is not a function almost always means that your require('retry-as-promised') call is returning something other than the function you expect—most commonly an empty object or undefined. Here are the main causes and ways to fix it:

1. Make Sure retry-as-promised Is Actually Installed
Even if you’ve run npm install retry-as-promised, sometimes in environments like Replit or Docker, the install can fail silently or install to a different location.

Check in your Replit shell (or project terminal) that retry-as-promised is listed:

bash
Copy
npm list retry-as-promised
If it says “not found,” install it again:
bash
Copy
npm install retry-as-promised
After installing, confirm with npm list retry-as-promised that it shows up properly.
Check your package.json to verify that retry-as-promised appears in dependencies.

2. Version Mismatch or ESM vs. CommonJS Issues
Depending on the version of retry-as-promised (and your Node/ESM configuration), you may need to import it differently:

A. Default CommonJS Usage (most common)
If your package.json does not have "type": "module", this code typically works:

js
Copy
const retry = require('retry-as-promised');

async function getClient() {
  return retry(async () => {
    // ...
  }, {
    max: 3,
    // etc...
  });
}
B. Named Import If Default Export Is Missing
Some versions export the function under retryAsPromised instead of default export. In that case:

js
Copy
const { retryAsPromised } = require('retry-as-promised');

async function getClient() {
  return retryAsPromised(async () => {
    // ...
  }, {
    max: 3,
    // ...
  });
}
You can alias it back to retry if you want:

js
Copy
const { retryAsPromised: retry } = require('retry-as-promised');
C. ESM Import
If your project is using ESM modules (e.g. "type": "module" in package.json), you might need:

js
Copy
import retry from 'retry-as-promised';
Or:

js
Copy
import { retryAsPromised } from 'retry-as-promised';
3. Debug the Require Directly
A quick way to see what you’re actually getting from require('retry-as-promised') is to just log it:

js
Copy
const retry = require('retry-as-promised');
console.log('retry-as-promised import:', retry);
If you see {} or undefined, it’s definitely not exporting the function.
If you see a function body, then it should work.
4. Clean Out node_modules and Reinstall
Sometimes a corrupted node_modules folder or lock file can cause unexpected “not a function” errors. If nothing else works:

Remove node_modules:
bash
Copy
rm -rf node_modules
Remove package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) if you have no special version constraints.
Reinstall:
bash
Copy
npm install
# or
yarn install
Confirm again with:
bash
Copy
npm list retry-as-promised
5. Try a Simpler Retry Library (Optional)
If you continue to have trouble, you can switch to a simpler retry library such as async-retry. For example:

bash
Copy
npm install async-retry
Then:

js
Copy
const retry = require('async-retry');

async function getClient() {
  return await retry(async (bail, attempt) => {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    return client;
  }, {
    retries: 5,
    onRetry: (err, attempt) => {
      console.log(`Database connection attempt ${attempt}: ${err.message}`);
    },
  });
}
But if you prefer retry-as-promised, the key is to ensure you have the right version installed and the correct import approach for your Node environment.
