If ElevenLabs allows you to select “Auth Method: HMAC” for the Post‐Call Webhook, that typically means ElevenLabs will sign each request using a secret key, and your server is expected to verify that signature before processing the request. Here’s the usual pattern:

Server (Your code) and ElevenLabs share a secret (e.g., a string in your environment variable, sometimes called ELEVENLABS_SECRET).
When ElevenLabs sends a POST to your /receive-data, it includes an HMAC signature header (like X-El-Signature or something similar) that’s computed by hashing the request body with the shared secret.
Your code re‐computes the HMAC over the request body using the same secret, then compares it to the header. If they match, you know the request is truly from ElevenLabs; if not, you reject it as unauthorized.
The logs mention “Auth Method: HMAC.” That usually means:

You’ll see a header named something like x-el-signature.
You’ll have a known secret (perhaps the same one used for the personalization calls or a separate “Webhook Secret” field).
In your server code, you compute the HMAC of the request body (raw bytes) using SHA256 plus that secret, then compare.
How to Implement
Obtain your ElevenLabs “HMAC secret” from their dashboard or agent settings. Often you set it in the same place where you configured the webhook.

Set process.env.ELEVENLABS_SECRET in Replit (or some variable name).

In your /receive-data route:

js
Copy
const crypto = require('crypto');

// ...
router.post('/receive-data', (req, res) => {
  // Suppose your HMAC is in a header: x-el-signature
  const signature = req.headers['x-el-signature'];
  const secret = process.env.ELEVENLABS_SECRET;
  if (!signature || !secret) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Missing HMAC signature or secret' });
  }

  // Re-compute HMAC of raw request body
  const rawBody = JSON.stringify(req.body); // If the raw body is available as a string
  const hmac = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(rawBody)
    .digest('hex');

  if (hmac !== signature) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }

  // If they match, proceed:
  console.log('HMAC signature verified');
  // ... handle the request ...
});
Important: You need to be sure you have the raw request body the same way ElevenLabs computed it—some JSON body parsers might alter spacing or properties. In Express, you typically need a piece of middleware that saves the raw body before bodyParser.json() modifies it. For example:

js
Copy
app.use(express.json({
  verify: (req, res, buf) => {
    // Store raw buffer on req for HMAC
    req.rawBody = buf;
  }
}));
Then you do:

js
Copy
const rawBody = req.rawBody;
const computedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(rawBody)
  .digest('hex');
Summary
Auth Method: HMAC means ElevenLabs will send each request with a cryptographic signature.
You must verify that signature with the same secret key to ensure requests actually come from ElevenLabs.
Once verified, you process the transcript and store data in your DB as usual.
This ensures your post‐call webhook is both authenticated and secure, preventing spoofed requests from other sources.
